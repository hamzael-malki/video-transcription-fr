the phone if a man and this kind of margin is community was one to doctor and said i want to have my arm cut off do think that i don't i really do with gender identity lots are of someone's someone's self identity as wanted to that sounds of that someone who has a on a and accept accepted as a mental diagnosis a psychiatric condition i don't even pretend to know what abdomen a feeling is all about but somehow and see idea that you are now you know you're fascinated or charmed by having a lamb or part of a limb missing mean okay i would say that's a pardon my nonmedical language cookie you don't see any way things are totally irrelevant so the biggest brought his question is what is a woman a woman is a you know it's a combination of your physical attributes and then what you're showing to the world and than gender clues that should give and hopefully those match or gender identity the critics on the other side of this of of this or this issue there aren't many but go ahead there are many who would disagree with what you're saying about well you know the dinosaurs that the world are certainly out there how long have you been running the shocker twenty five years oh know you had an incident here a little while ago that when really viral online a lotta reaction in the public aberdeen councilwoman ts a mask is confronted owner dawn sucre about sign he posted in his store one day i just put the sign up over here and a table around the corner i start okay i recognize and i says oh all i recognize you you are new city councilman he says no i'm your new city council woman so it was it was kind of on from there you know like shit know what you're spouting you know if not an oregon and that fine if i've been doing this twenty five years i've never had a problem with anybody whether they're gay transact anything not you're saying council man key this individual a saying i'm a woman right and moon and you said you're not a woman had i think i know that that person's i wonder how do i know well a common sense it doesn't doesn't the science say that if someone identifies as a woman then they are no no no that's completely bogus i don't care if you think are sheep dog and you come into my store it don't matter to me just don't come in and try to shove that shit down my throat even make someone feel better or rather for their feelings i don't give a shit about their feelings on all around a star wars universe george our banks and sexual do think transgendered why why why would i even care if it's is truth was it ain't to who you're not a scientist or not a gender studies major or are you know how do you know by your man i do i know that my i guess because i've got a debt well i just don isn't over thinking it he admits he's not a gender studies major for the very least a doctor maybe i should go talk to one my name is michelle for cia and i have a medical degree from university of connecticut residents see university of utah pediatrics and i've worked for a number of different planned parenthood for twenty years i do advance contraception and abortion as well as gender hormones and sort of looking at the whole sort of scheme of gender or sex and and reproductive justice so you don't a lot of work in israel could use a start by telling us share of at what age can a child first begin to transition into another gender or identify themselves as a gender different from how they were born here where me and there's there's research and data that show that babies and infants understand differences and gender some children figure out their gender really early and the reason why we aren't say oh that's that's interesting or important because they're figuring out their gender identity is not necessarily can ruin with their sex assigned at birth where they were the doctor seuss the penis and says this is a male has sex of male that's a arbitrary distinction telling that family based on that little penis that your child is absolutely one hundred percent male identified no matter what else occurs in their life that's not correct so what does gender affirmation carrier a big proponent of for a walk through a child is sitting down with year was questioning their their gender what's the gender affirmation process affirmation means that as a pediatrician as someone who says my job is to provide the best medical care for you is i need illness and really carefully and how i put it in words for kids said that they can understand it is tommy your story where have you been and terms in your gender and your gender identity where you're right now and more excitingly where would you like to be in the future i've ever met a four year old who believes in santa claus says to someone who believes that the fat man is traveling through the sky and a flying reindeer at lightning speed coming down as chimney with presence would you say to this is someone who maybe has a tenuous grasp on reality they have an appropriate for your old handle undreamt agree that's very real for them agreed agreed but santa claus israel for them but they're santa claus is not actually get what and but santa confidence deliver their christmas presents we have it is not real though to that child they are but i see a child who you know believes in santa claus and then let's say this is a boy and he says i'm a girl this is someone who can't distinguish between fantasy and reality so how could you take that as a reality i wouldn't say that as a pediatrician and as a parent i went to say how wonderful my four year old and their imagination as aren't kids famous for their active imaginations shouldn't really let our children find reality if i say that i feel a certain way then obviously beseech on the i don't feel that way but just because i feel that way is i mean is that is true i mean if the i've truly like none of my business so we all have our own i didn't realities what have i said i want you to say that it's true that i'm a woman would you say that i would have that you yeah i honestly don't care whatever makes you walk through to you can have evolved to me sound like a lot of i say that it's true my truth is that you don't exist because i mean you no longer exist i mean if that's you actually can i don't think i you do i mean if you're saying that i do well but even if i said the you don't you still do because we're rabbits conversation i when i think that all i mean i thought that's what you're saying well i should have known would be hard to define reality and hollywood i should probably look to the place where truth is the foremost pursuit the american university what we do in in gender studies is not just reduce gender to what psychologist may call individual differences for rather thinking about gender and that's not women and man but gender as a as a social form something that kind of infuses itself into virtually all aspects of social life or sorry about that then i guess we should start with we've got gender and sex writer what what's the difference between the two is there a difference i saw that in your questions and i thought my goodness this is what we spend an entire semester kind of thinking through boot what we tend to think about in the social sciences today is that sex refers to a set of biological characteristics and gender is a social construct or category what i think is often misleading about that characterization allowed to be served messy and complicated but in that free man when you split them up into these quality discreet constructs study scholars and and really more specifically people who stay genuine sex were talking about sexuality in that kind of academic universe that i travel a is that we see how to do gendered ideas on culture idea is a lot masculine or feminine male nurse and the known as both in humans and and lots of other animals so our gender and sex two different things or well i think that they they both are
